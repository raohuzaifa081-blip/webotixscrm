# Webotixs Agency CRM

A professional, high-performance Agency CRM designed for design and development teams. It automates onboarding workflows and provides role-specific dashboards.

## Features

- **RBAC (Role Based Access Control)**:
    - **Admin**: Full control over clients, team, and reporting.
    - **Team**: View personal tasks and update their specific status.
    - **Client**: Real-time project progress tracking.
- **Automated Workflow**: Adding a client creates a Project + 4 Tasks (Content -> UI/UX -> Dev -> SEO) assigned to relevant specialists.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, and responsive layouts.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time project percentage calculation based on task completion.

    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "Master Admin", "email": "admin@webotixs.com", "password": "password123", "role": "admin"}'
